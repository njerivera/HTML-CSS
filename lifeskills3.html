	<h1>WHY IS IT SO RAMPANT?</h1>
	<div class="vera">

		<div class="v1">
			<p>We are in a phase of time where family seems to be unimportant anymore.Most people have foresaken family terming it as not important and too fake.One thing i always ask myself is if ,it is the right thing to do.If everyone chooses to do the same ,then who  will be left to mend the broken gaps that are being hugely left behind.For instance parents are so busy occupied with work that they hardly notice the presence of their kids.Some parents have even forgotten matters school about their kids.Pick a random parent and ask them the education history of their child and they do not remember. </p>
		 

		 
		 <p>I asked a friend of mine what made her not  have a close relationship with her mother and  she said it is beceuase of fear.When i dug deeper she confessed that in their family kids have no say thus finding it difficult to relate with their parents.This has gone to another level where girls even fear asking for sanitary towels.Fear of expressing herself,fear of stating her progress,fear of stating her challenges."How I wish my parents could understand my feelings and guide me when am at the end",she declared this as tears flew freely.I do not put all the blame on parents because at times kids might not have expressed how they feel,but again what if they did and no one paid attention?
		 	
		 </p>
		</div>


		<div class="v2">
			<p>Family has become so unsupportive,it is almost like rivalry between parents and kids.Enemity has struck in families.Unsupportive parents and realtives have made some youngsters who could be shinning right now give up on their talents."You can not sing!We do not have a history of singing in this family!Don't even waste your time trying to sing."That is the unfortunate thing some kids get to hear in their houses.Imagine it is your last prize giving day in school and you have done your best only for your family  not turn up for your big day.
			It is heart breaking and demoralizing.This family neglection has led to increased cases of murder in the recent past.Kids commit suicide leaving behind a note for the unsupportive parents and siblings something that they could have worked on and save that kids life.

			</p>

			<p>Spouses killing each other or commiting suicide basically because depression has increased over the recent  years.Others leaving home thus icreasing the number of single parents families. </p>
			<p>This are issues that can be solved ,let's dedicate time for kids and parents.Let's embrace humanity and bring up a generetion of sane kids who value human life more tahn anything else.</p>
